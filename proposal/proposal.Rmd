r# The proposal

Our proposal is to rebuild the PriorGen R package for making it a place-to-go for generating priors later to be used in Bayesian modeling. PriorGen was built for translating beliefs into prior information in the form of Beta and Gamma distributions. It can be mainly used for the generation of priors on the prevalence of disease and the sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tests. This basic idea will be improved to make PriorGen a general purpose tool for translating prior beliefs in the form of statistical distribution and make it the engine of a Shiny App for a user-friendly experience.


## Overview

Our proposal aims at increasing the use of Bayesian methods with a user-friendly experience with the process of generating priors.


## Detail

The minimum viable product is an R package that provides a set of R functions to generate prior distributions from probability statements generated by the users.
The architecture will be kept simple, with an intensive use of rootSolve package.
Then PriorGen package and Shiny App will be coded and tested. A final version of PriorGen package will be released on CRAN. A PriorGen GitHub repository will serve for the project before and after package
