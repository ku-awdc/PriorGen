# Requirements
 
There are no external requirements that must be fulfilled to enable this project.  The maintainers of both PriorGen and runjags packages that will be directly affected by this proposal are directly involved.  The project team are already actively collaborating so have a proven ability to be willing and able to work together.

## Division of labour

The majority of the coding within the redeveloped R package will be done by Matt Denwood. Polychronis Kostoulas will take charge of coordinating and generating feedback and suggestions in terms of the usability of the interface provided, and additional distributions and scenarios to include.  The direct involvement of both the LCMATE mailing list community and contributors to the related COST action activites will be central to this.  Paolo Eusebi will take the main responsibility for ensuring that the outputs are valid and correct from a mathematical perspective.  However, active involvement of each member of the team in all activities is envisaged.

## Processes
 
A code of conduct will be approved to facilitate a constructive behavior for the project contributors. 

Regular meetings will be scheduled and regular feedback requested from our large network of professionals, researchers and developers.


## Tools & Tech

All of the necessary infrastructure, hardware and software is provided by the institutions of the team members.  In particular, costs for maintaining the publically available app at https://www.shinyapps.io will be met by the University of Copenhagen.

## Funding
 
For the realisation of this project, the total amount of $12,000 is requested.  The majority of these costs are to cover staff time, with a small amount to be used for travel expenses to attend project meetings.  The costs are broken down into the following 3 phases of work:

* Phase 1:  Start-up - $3,000
* Phase 2:  Code Delivery - $6,000
* Phase 3:  Dissemination - $3,000
