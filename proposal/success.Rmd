# Success
 
Our final goal is a delivery of an r pakage that could also serve as an engine for a Shiny app.


## Definition of done
 
The project is finished when an R package is on CRAN with available documentation in the form of package manuals and vignettes.
Shiny app and r package should be available at the dedicate d GitHub repository.


## Measuring success
 
* The R package will be developed on a GitHub repository, so that issues and commit messages can be tracked to see the project status
* Regular reports to the R consortium will be provided


## Future work
 
This proposal is an important step in the direction of a wide spreading adoption of Bayesian paradigm. 
Follow-up steps will include:

* Refinemnt of Shiny app
* Updating of the package functionalities with respect to the evolving body of the literature.


## Key risks
 
We think that the risks should be low-moderate, in particular we could foreseen the following events (with actions to take):

* Contributors overwhelmed by work. This risk should be mitigated by an effective code of conduct and by a definition of a set of functionalities to define a minimum viable product.
* Running out of cost. This risk should be minimized by the possibility to enlarge the developers community. IN fact, the core team has a large network of scientific collaborations.
* Poor communications. This risk is minimized with the adoption of a code of conduct and the use of dedicated tools like Trello board.
