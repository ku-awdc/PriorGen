# Success
 
## Definition of done
 
The project will be deemed to be successfully completed when an R package is on CRAN (including documentation in the form of package manuals and vignettes), and an interactive Shiny app is publically hosted at https://www.shinyapps.io


## Measuring success
 
* The R package will be developed on a GitHub repository, so that issues and commit messages can be tracked to see the project status
* Regular reports to the R consortium will be provided
* Uptake of the PriorGen package will be encouraged and monitored (both within and outside our domain-specific fields of application)

## Future work
 
This proposal is an important step towards a more wide-spread adoption of Bayesian methods.  Future work will include:

* Ongoing refinemnt of the code base and Shiny app
* Tighter integration with other software and R packages such as runjags
* Updating the package functionality to address the evolving needs within the literature


## Key risks
 
The risks associated with this project are low, however the following adverse events (and remedial actions) are potentially envisaged:

* *The project team (and other contributors) being overwhelmed by other work*.  The project team hold relatively senior positions within their respective institutions, which can cause issues with regards to balancing workloads.  This risk should be mitigated by an effective code of conduct, and by clear allocation of time resources to the project.  Involvement of additional people to contribute to the code base would certainly be a bonus, but is not being assumed for the purposes of the costings presented.
* *Insufficient resources associated with the project*.  This risk is minimized by co-running this project alongside related research activities, not least the recently-funded COST action on tools for diagnostic test evaluation and disease prevalence estimation.  This ensures that this project becomes embedded within a larger body of work with real momentum and the possibility of securing additional resources where objectives overlap.  This will also help to enlarge the community of developers associated with this project.
* *Poor communication*. This risk is minimized with the adoption of a code of conduct, the use of dedicated tools like Trello board, and the use of GitHub to manage open issues.
