# The Problem

Over the lifetime of R there has been increasing interest in Bayesian analysis (BA) methods, driven partly by such appealing features as the ability to make inference on complex data structures, and provide a comprehensive view of parameter uncertainty. Bayesian posterior distributions provide us with point estimates such as posterior means, medians, percentiles, and credible (or probability) interval estimates that have direct applicability to a wide variety of statistical applications. BA has therefore continued to expand, and is displacing existing methods based on classical statistics in a wide range of fields. A huge potential strength of BA is the ability to combine existing, relevant information with the observed data by incoroprating priors into the estimation process. This allows the posterior distribution of inference to naturally combine two sources of information:  what we knew before collecting the data (the prior), and what the data tells us (the likelihood). Depending on the chosen prior, distribution and likelihood model, the posterior distribution may then be available analytically, or alternatively it can be approximated by a method such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, this necessarily introduces an additional step into the analysis that is not encountered during an analysis based on classical statistics:  how to define the prior distribution.

The selection (and justification) of prior distributions for common problems continues to be a topic of considerable uncertainty within a number of applications, with even relatively experienced users often lacking an intuitive feeling for the shape and coverage of commonly used priors based on e.g. Beta and Gamma distributions.  These problems are typically confounded by the lack of mathematical and statistical experience typically encountered when communicating with the experts that may represent a major the source of relevant prior information. As pointed out by Gelman, Simpson and Betancourt in 2017 (arxiv.org/abs/1708.07487), much of the recent progresses in BA points toward the benefits of including real, subject-matter-specific, prior information to get more stable and accurate inferences. This puts new and significant burdens on the developers and users of Bayesian methods, and an obligation for statisticians to develop default priors, or more generally procedures for researchers to build bespoke priors, going beyond the traditional recommendations. At the same time, those researchers need to recognize the importance of the prior and spend the time encoding their expertise in probabilistic form.  This process is not straightforward.

In order to help alleviate this problem, we envisage a tool that can be used to support the selection of prior distributions within BA for commonly used statistical models, within a package that allows the user to specify and explore the properties of different prior distributions interactively. Input could be from a variety of sources, for example simple summary statistics (mean and 95% confidence intervals), or summary of opinion elicitation from relevant experts. In order for the package to be most useful it should provide an interactive Shiny application that can be used both by experienced and novice R users to interactively play with tables, histograms or densities to express their prior beliefs. PriorGen is a package on CRAN that addresses some of these objectives, but has a relatively limited (non-interactive) interface, and is focussed on the use of beta and gamma distributed priors for estimation of disease prevalence and the sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tests. We propose to expand the PriorGen package to meet the challenges of prior specification within a modern Bayesian analysis framework.
